  "body": "### Summary\r\nAs datasets from high-throughput technology grow increasingly complex, novel approaches are needed to visually convey key findings on multiple, related-levels of data quickly and effectively. Director is an [R](http://www.r-project.org/) package designed to streamline the visualization of regulatory, downstream effect in a biological network. It utilizes a customized Sankey plugin of the JavaScript library [D3](http://d3js.org) to provide a fast and easy, browser-enabled solution to discovering potentially interesting molecular interactions that would not otherwise be evident using standard network visualization or statistical methods alone. The diagrams are robust, interactive, and packaged as highly-portable HTML files that eliminate the need for third-party software to view.\r\n\r\nRead more with a basic walkthrough in the [package vignette](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kzouchka/Director/master/vignettes/vignette.pdf).\r\n\r\n![Example diagram from vignette](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kzouchka/Director/master/vignettes/figure4.png)\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nInstall Director from its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kzouchka/Director). In R, you first need to\r\ninstall [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) and ensure Bioconductor is a named source.\r\n\r\n```r\r\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\r\nsource(\"https://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R\")`\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen using the 'install_github' function in the [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package:\r\n\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(\"kzouchka/Director\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Example use\r\nThe following test case draws a set of regulating miRNAs and their target genes in key biological pathways using default package settings.\r\n\r\n```r\r\nlibrary(Director)\r\ndata(ovca) # import data\r\ninitSankey() # same as initSankey(directory=getwd())\r\nLevel1 <- createList(poorprog$Level1) # miRNA-gene data\r\nLevel2 <- createList(poorprog$Level2) # gene-pathway data.\r\nList <- append2List(Level1, Level2) # append lists.\r\n\r\nSankey <- makeSankey(List, averagePath = TRUE) # calculate colour values\r\nSankeyd <- drawSankey(Sankey,caption=\"Regulatory pathway\",\r\nwidth=1400, height=900) # raw HTML generated\r\nwriteSankey(name=\"FDRpathways\") # write to working directory as ’FDRpathways.html’\r\n\r\n# Use the following to relaunch the diagram as a web page\r\nlibrary(htmltools)\r\nhtml_print(Sankeyd)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### License\r\nDirector as a whole is distributed under [GPL-3 (GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE version 3)](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html).\r\n\r\nThe package incorporates\r\n- [D3.js](http://d3js.org) \\[[license](https://github.com/kzouchka/Director/blob/master/LICENSE)\\]\r\n\r\n### Citing\r\nTo cite Director, please use [Icay, K.; Liu, C.; Hautaniemi, S.
